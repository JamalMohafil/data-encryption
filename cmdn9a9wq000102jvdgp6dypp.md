Hello everyone  
I‚Äôm Jamal, a 16-year-old developer working on a big e-commerce project. Today I wanna share something crazy that happened to me while building the backend.

---

## The Problem

Everything was going well until I had to build the **product creation**.

Each product in my system has more than 15 related parts:

* Images (with translations)
    
* Videos (with translations)
    
* Reviews
    
* Cart items
    
* Wishlist items
    
* Attributes (with translations)
    
* Dimensions (with translations)
    
* Materials (with translations)
    
* Options (with images and translations for each option and translations for each image)
    
* Details (with translations)
    
* and more...
    

Some of these even have their own translations. For example, an attribute might have a translation in Arabic and English. So when the admin tries to create one product with all this data the request takes more than **6 seconds**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That‚Äôs bad no one wants to wait that long.

## The Idea üí°

I started reading and researching and remembered something I already used before: **event-driven architecture**.

I used it for small things like sending emails. But then I asked myself:

> *"Why not use events to handle product creation too?"*

Instead of doing everything in one go, why not:

* Save the **basic product** first.
    
* Then fire an **event**.
    
* Let that event process all the heavy stuff in the background.
    

Boom üí• ‚Äî that worked! The API now responds in under **100ms**, and all the other stuff happens behind the scenes.

---

## How I Did It üîß

### Step 1: Create the Event

```typescript
export class ProductCoreCreatedEvent implements IEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly productId: string,
    public readonly product: ProductAggregate,
    public readonly userId: string,
  ) {}
}
```

### Step 2: Handle the Event

```typescript
@EventsHandler(ProductCoreCreatedEvent)
export class ProductCoreCreatedEventHandler
  implements IEventHandler<ProductCoreCreatedEvent> {
  async handle(event: ProductCoreCreatedEvent) {
    const { product, productId, userId } = event;

    await Promise.allSettled([
      this.processTranslations(productId, product.getAllTranslations()),
      this.processImages(productId, product.getImages()),
      this.processVideos(productId, product.getVideos()),
      this.processAttributes(productId, product.getAllAttributes()),
      this.processOptions(productId, product.getAllOptions()),
      this.processDimensions(productId, product.getDimension()),
      this.processDetails(productId, product.getDetails()),
      this.processAssemblyGuide(productId, product.getAssemblyGuide()),
      this.processMaterials(productId, product.getMaterials()),
    ]);

    await this.eventBus.publishCqrsEvent(
      new ProductFullyProcessedEvent(productId, userId, 'CREATE'),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Command Handler

Instead of handling everything in the command, I just send the event:

```typescript
@CommandHandler(CreateProductCommand)
export class CreateProductCommandHandler
  implements ICommandHandler<CreateProductCommand> {
  async execute(command: CreateProductCommand): Promise<any> {
    // Do basic validation
    const isSkuUnique = await this.repo.isSkuUnique(command.props.sku);
    if (!isSkuUnique) throw new BadRequestException('SKU must be unique');

    const productCore = this.buildProductCore(command);
    await this.repo.createCore(productCore);

    // Fire the event in the background
    setImmediate(() => {
      this.eventBus.publishCqrsEvent(
        new ProductCoreCreatedEvent(productCore.id, productCore, command.userId),
      );
    });

    return true;
  }
}
```

## The Result üöÄ

‚úÖ Request time went from **6 seconds** to **under 100msüî•**  
‚úÖ No more waiting for the user  
‚úÖ Product still gets fully created in the background  
‚úÖ Clean and scalable architecture

I even did the same thing for **product updates**, because they were slow too. Now updates also run in the background.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This method is great for background work ‚Äî but **don‚Äôt use it when the user needs an immediate result**.

For example:

* If you're doing a `getProductById`, you can‚Äôt use an event.
    
* If you're checking if a slug or name is unique, that **has to be done before** sending the event.
    

If you move important checks inside the event, and an error happens, the user won‚Äôt see it ‚Äî it‚Äôll just crash in the terminal.

So always do your **validations before** sending the event.

## Final Words

This trick saved me and I hope it helps you too. If you‚Äôre working on a big system and feel your API is too slow try using **event-driven architecture**. Trust me, it works.

Thanks for reading!  
I‚Äôm just getting started on my coding journey, and I‚Äôll be sharing more cool stuff soon.
