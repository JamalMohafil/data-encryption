Hello everyone,

In today’s interconnected world we often download and use apps without giving much thought to where they come from or who controls them. Many of us, knowingly or unknowingly, rely on Chinese apps every single day. I was no exception.

### **The Red Flags**

One day, while working with the Trae Code Editor, I realized my internet usage was abnormally high — even when I wasn’t actively downloading anything. Curious, I decided to investigate. Using network monitoring tools I learned from multiple independent reports that some Chinese apps have been found to collect significant amounts of personal data — such as location, contacts, and even clipboard content — often in ways that raise concerns about user consent.

This wasn’t just harmless analytics data. I found that the app was transmitting:

* My **device information**
    
* Various **configuration files**
    
* And even **sensitive personal data**
    

When I saw the nature of the files being sent, my reaction was pure shock: *“What the hell?!”*

I dug deeper, and the pattern was alarming. It wasn’t just Trae Code Editor. Similar data transmissions were happening with TikTok and a few other Chinese apps I had installed. This made me realize something very serious: these applications weren’t just tools for entertainment or productivity — they were potentially sophisticated **data collection systems**.

### **The Bigger Picture**

Many people don’t know this, but TikTok, for example, is owned by ByteDance, a company whose legal obligations under Chinese law have raised concerns among foreign regulators about possible government access to data. Several government reports and court filings have discussed the national-security risk and potential for cross-border access to user data.

Recent court documents and regulatory actions show this is an active, unresolved subject.

When you think about it, it’s a perfect setup: create an addictive app, make it free, and gather unprecedented amounts of information from millions (or even billions) of devices worldwide. (There are many academic, policy and investigative pieces that analyze this business model and data-collection incentives.)

### **The Turning Point**

After learning about potential privacy and security concerns raised by independent cybersecurity experts and official reports, I made a personal decision:

I removed all Chinese-developed apps from my devices, based on findings reported by reputable sources such as [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/07/tiktoks-china-bytedance-data-concerns) and **F**[**orbes**.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/07/11/tiktok-seriously-dangerous-warning-delete-app-trump-ban)

I also sold my Xiaomi phone — a brand that has been subject to privacy-related allegations according to multiple investigations — and switched to alternatives from companies based in Turkey and the United States.

### **No Offense to Good Chinese People**

Let me be clear: my criticism is aimed at **companies and government practices**, not individuals. I have no problem with ordinary Chinese citizens — many are as frustrated with their own system as we are. But we can’t ignore the reality that certain companies operate in ways that seriously threaten global privacy and security.

### **A Nod to Strong Leadership**

I salute leaders and innovators who stand against digital threats from Donald J. Trump’s decisive actions to limit the influence of Chinese tech companies, to Turkey’s fast-growing community of developers who are building secure, world-class applications. These examples show that when determination meets innovation, it’s possible to protect user privacy while also offering engaging, high-quality digital experiences.

Turkey, in particular, has been making notable progress in becoming a rising tech hub. From privacy-focused messaging apps and advanced gaming studios to innovative fintech solutions and scalable e-commerce platforms, Turkish companies are proving they can compete on the global stage. Supporting such efforts — whether in the United States, Turkey, or any other country that values digital sovereignty — helps strengthen global security, encourage healthy competition, and provide people everywhere with safer, more trustworthy alternatives.

### **The Reality We Live In**

We all want to live in a world of peace, fairness, and mutual respect. But unfortunately, history — and even present-day events — shows us that there will always be **power struggles** and **conflicts**. The digital space is just the newest battleground.

If we want to protect ourselves, we need to stay informed, remain cautious about the apps we use, and understand the unseen cost of “free” services.

**Final Thoughts**

Thank you for reading my story. I’m sharing this not to spread fear, but to encourage awareness. Technology is an incredible tool, but like any tool, it can be used for both good and harm. Always do your research, monitor your privacy settings, and think twice before granting any app full access to your personal life.

Stay safe, stay informed, and choose wisely.
