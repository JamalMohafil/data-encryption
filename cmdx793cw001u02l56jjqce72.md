Hello everyone,  
I’m **Jamal**

As the title says: **don’t trust fake advertisers — no matter how good the offer sounds**.

I have been creating content since 2024 and today I thank myself to be consistent until have over **18.5K followers on Instagram** and **13.5K subscribers on YouTube**.

Throughout this journey I’ve received **tons of messages** from supposed “advertisers” asking me to promote their products or services or websites.

At first I said to myself: *“Great! Collaborations and money that’s a win, right?”*

Well… **only if they were real**.

Unfortunately, **most of the advertisers** who reached out to me whether through Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok turned out to be **completely fake**. Just scammers.

Here’s how it usually goes:  
They say, *“We’ll pay you $100 per video if it reaches 100K views. If not, you get nothing.”*  
I reply politely, *“Okay, that’s fine but we should have a contract to ensure that everthing is clear I need a small down payment to cover editing and design costs.”*

As soon as I say this, they disappear.  
They send the same copy-paste excuse:

> *“Hey Jamal, just wanted to let you know our marketing team decided to pause new collaborations for now. Really appreciate your time — we might reach out in the future. Thanks!”*

It happens over and over.  
**The moment I ask for a contract or a small upfront payment, they vanish.**

So I wanted to write this blog just to give this advice:

> ***Don’t trust anyone just because they promise you money most Instagram advertisers are fake.***

I spend over **7 hours a day** creating **free content and free courses** to help people not to be fooled by fake promises.

At first, I thought these offers might help cover my content costs, even just a little. But I learned the truth the hard way:

> ***If it sounds too good to be true — it probably is.***

But I’m not stopping.  
These people won’t break me.  
I’ve learned so much from this experience and I’m truly **grateful to have learned it at 16**, not later in life when the stakes are higher.

Thank you for reading.  
I hope my experience helps you avoid the same mistakes.  
**Stay smart, stay focused.**  
And never stop creating. 💪

— Jamal
